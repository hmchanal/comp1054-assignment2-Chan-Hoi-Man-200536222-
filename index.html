        <p class="lyrics_ref">I spy with my little tired eye<br>
            Tiny as a firefly<br>
            A pebble that we picked up last July<br>
            Down deep inside your pocket<br>
            We almost forgot it<br>
            Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?<br>
            Ooh, ooh</p>

            Everyone’s up to somethin'<br>
            I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings<br>
            Outside, they’re push and shovin'<br>
            You're in the kitchen hummin'<br>
            All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'</p>

                I wrote a poem<br>
                You say, "What a mind"<br>
                This happens all the time<br>
                Ooh, ooh</p>
